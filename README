This is the University of Washington apache authorization
module (mod_uwa).  

Build, install and run
----------------------

See doc/install.html for installation instructions.
See doc/mod_uwa.html for user instructions.


Debugging the ldap interface.
-----------------------------

Build the module with

  -DMOD_UWA_DEBUG

to get more output from the module as it tries to 
contact the ldap server.  To exploit this run
your apache in 'single user' mode: with a "-X".

Build with 

  -DUWA_LDAP_DEBUG_LEVEL=9

to get even more debug output.
